Kupp continues to dominate after the catch, ranking top 12 in RAC in each of his five NFL seasons. It's reasonable to expect Kupp to come back to earth this season, especially considering he's now 29 years old and has missed action in three of five NFL seasons, but he's still a lock for a substantial target share in one of the league's top offenses. He should be off the board early in Round 1.",

Taylor found the end zone 20 times and his 26 carries inside the opponent's 5-yard line were the most the league had seen in a single season since 2012. An uptick in passing-game work would be nice (unlikely with Nyheim Hines in the mix), but Taylor's age (23), massive usage in a run-heavy offense and top-end efficiency are plenty enough to allow continued elite production.

Adams also has more competition for targets, he's now 29 years old and he tends to miss the occasional game or two.

Ekeler had the highest floor at the position, as he was the only back to produce at least 9.5 fantasy points in every game he played. He was very lucky in the TD department (20 TDs, 11.1 expected) and will regress, but he sees more than enough volume to remain a top fantasy back (14th in carries and second in targets among RBs in 2021). In his prime at age 27 and working in one of the league's top-scoring offenses, Ekeler is well positioned for his third top-three fantasy campaign in four seasons.",

The good news is that he's positioned as New Orleans' lead back and will remain a featured target in the pass game (he's never finished lower than fifth among RBs in targets). There are concerns, however. Kamara's efficiency took a big hit without Drew Brees around last season (career-low 3.74 YPC and 66% catch rate) and he's unlikely to hold up for 17 games (he's missed at least one game each of the last four seasons). Kamara is also in jeopardy of a multi-game suspension for an offseason arrest. The 27-year-old is a strong bet for RB1 production when active, but he'll be a risky early-round investment until his off-field situation is resolved.",

In 11 games with Jackson, Andrews averaged 7.9 targets and 14.9 fantasy PPG (four top-five weeks). In six games with Jackson out, Andrews averaged 10.8 targets and 22.9 fantasy PPG (top five all six weeks). This suggests Andrews may not continue his late-season surge, but the departure of Marquise Brown locks him into a massive target share. Also, he has never finished lower than fifth at the position in average depth of target and he's been top two in end zone targets each of the last three seasons. Andrews is an elite fantasy asset and positioned for his fourth straight top-six fantasy campaign.",

Samuel finished no lower than second in yards per reception, yards per target, yards per route run and top-10 fantasy weeks. He is nothing short of an elite playmaker, as he's averaging 6.2 yards per carry and a WR-best 9.7 RAC since he was drafted.

Herbert's passing output was obviously outstanding, but he also added some value with his legs, ranking top 10 in carries, yards and TDs. Defensive enhancements could lead to less late-game throwing from Herbert this season, but the Chargers operated the game-script-adjusted fourth-pass-heaviest offense last season, and a loaded AFC will mean plenty of close games.

McPherson also nailed 52-of-54 extra points (96.3%) and finished the regular season seventh in fantasy points. Cincinnati's offense only figures to be better this season following big upgrades up front, so McPherson has the look of a top fantasy option.",

Of course, Conner was productive even with Edmonds active thanks to heavy usage near the goal line. Conner registered 12 carries from opponent's 1-yard line, which was three more than any other player. He finished no lower than third among RBs in TDs (18), expected TDs (11.8) and carries inside the 5-yard line (16). Probable TD regression is likely to be offset by more touches, so 27-year-old Conner is very much on the RB1 radar and has top-five upside.",

Perhaps the new coaching regime will re-ignite Barkley's career -- he's only 25 years old and has minimal competition for touches -- but the rough 2021 efficiency and 21 missed games over the last three seasons means we must lower expectations.

Gordon is back, but a reduced role is likely at age 29, especially with a new coaching staff in place.

Moore is the only player in NFL history with at least 1,100 receiving yards and fewer than five TDs in more than two seasons (he's done it each of the last three seasons). Still, the 25-year-old is heavily targeted (sixth at WR last season) and has overcome weak QB play to finish top 10 in receiving yards each of the past three seasons. He's a solid WR2 and, with any luck in the TD department, he could leap even higher, especially with Baker Mayfield now under center.",

Akers failed to impress off his surprising return from the Achilles injury during the playoffs (2.6 YPC), but he's only 23 years old and figures to be much closer to full strength come Week 1. Akers may be limited as a pass-catcher (especially with Darrell Henderson Jr. in the fold), but he's the lead back in an offense that is second in the league in carries inside the 5 since Sean McVay joined the team in 2017. Akers is a major breakout candidate.",

Waddle appears to be the real deal, though he may have trouble making a leap forward in 2022 with Tyreek Hill added to the fold.

Last season, the volume remained, but efficiency plummeted (Russell Wilson missing time didn't help) and Metcalf ended up 13th in fantasy (23rd in PPG) with a 75-967-12 line. He has a lot going for him -- he's 24 years old, perhaps the most physically intimidating WR in the league and oft-targeted deep downfield and near the goal line (top five in end zone targets in all three NFL seasons). However, Seattle has major QB issues with Russell Wilson out and Drew Lock in, which will hurt Metcalf in the scoring and efficiency departments. He's still in the WR2 mix, but riskier than in past years.",

After that, he saw a 19% share and was WR25. In total, he had eight top-20 fantasy outings, but was 40th or worse in his other eight games.

Denver's QB situation went from poor to great after the trade for Russell Wilson. Jeudy has already seen a decent target share (21%), but has an ugly 54% catch rate and only three touchdowns on 167 targets, including zero on 55 targets in 2021. We can anticipate much better efficiency and a big boost in scoring in 2022. Wilson led both DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett to fantasy stardom in Seattle and is a good bet to do the same for the super-talented Jeudy, who is safest as a WR3, but possesses elite upside.",

He is a well-built, three-down back who racked up 3,044 yards and 41 TDs on 532 carries during his final two seasons at Iowa State. Hall has passing-game chops, having caught 93 passes during three FBS seasons, and he rushed for a TD in an NCAA-record 24 consecutive games to finish his career. He's one of the youngest backs in this year's rookie class and he crushed the combine, running a 4.39 40-yard dash and posting a class-best 40-inch vert and 126-inch broad jump. Hall profiles as a potential feature back with a high fantasy ceiling, though Michael Carter will remain involved, especially in the passing game. Hall's combination of talent and opportunity should land him in the RB2 mix in 2022.",

Brady is 45 years old and doesn't offer much with his legs (81 yards last season), but he's still playing at an elite level, won't be short volume and has a good group of targets.

Sure, he'll have more competition moving forward (Jameson Williams and DJ Chark Jr. were added and both D'Andre Swift and T.J. Hockenson were hurt most of late last season), but St. Brown still has a clear path to a generous target share (and a few carries). He's on the WR2 radar.",

Burrow scored 32% of his fantasy points in those three games, which marked his only weekly finishes better than eighth for the season. That's a concern, but he has the benefit of arguably the league's best WR room, and an overhauled offensive line will help his cause after he took a league-high 51 sacks in 2021.

Despite managing only 35 touches in 2021, he tied for eighth in the league in end zone targets. With Emmanuel Sanders and Cole Beasley gone, Davis is primed for a much larger role in Buffalo's pass-heavy/high-scoring offense in 2022. There's some risk here considering Davis has yet to produce a top-55 fantasy campaign, but he's on a strikingly similar trajectory to Chris Godwin and is a major Year-3 breakout candidate. He's worth a look as a WR3/flex.",

On the plus side, he's only 27 and has a clear path to a hefty target share as Deshaun Watson's top target in Cleveland.

Of course, his efficiency has been great, as he's second at the position in catch rate and sixth in RAC since he was drafted (min. 200 targets). As good as Renfrow has been, the 26-year-old is ticketed for fewer targets this season with Davante Adams in the mix and Darren Waller back to full health.

The second part was the five games after McKissic's season-ending injury, during which Gibson averaged 15.0 carries and 4.6 targets and was sixth in fantasy points. In total, Gibson ended up no lower than eighth in touches, yards and touchdowns. McKissic is back and Washington drafted Brian Robinson Jr. in the third round, which is expected to lessen Gibson's role.

Despite sharing backfield duties with Nick Chubb, Hunt has been a productive fantasy back over the last two seasons. He was 11th among all RBs in fantasy points during six full games with Chubb in 2021 and was 13th in 11 games in 2020. Hunt has generally been limited to around one-third of the carries with Chubb in the mix, but his elite efficiency (NFL-best 2.4 YAC since he was drafted) and passing-game involvement have been enough to allow strong fantasy output. Hunt is safest as a flex target, but he has added value as one of the top insurance backs in the game.",

Sanders has missed nine games due to injury over the last two seasons, but he's been an effective rusher when active, ranking top 15 in yards per carry during each of his three pro seasons. He has, however, struggled as a receiver (4.2 YPT over the last two seasons) and figures to continue deferring some backfield work to Kenneth Gainwell and Boston Scott (not to mention Jalen Hurts). Sanders' TDs will regress to the mean and, if he stays healthy, there's a path to a big rebound season. That said, your safest bet is to target him as a flex.",

Of course, it's fair to worry about both scoring and efficiency with Russell Wilson out and Drew Lock in at quarterback.

He was especially busy at the goal line, finishing second in rushing TDs (15) and third in carries inside the 5-yard line (14). Harris has been an effective rusher (career 4.8 YPC, 1.9 YAC), but he averaged 13.0 carries and 1.1 targets per game once Rhamondre Stevenson stepped into a sizable role, and that was with James White on IR. Stevenson and perhaps a passing-down specialist (Ty Montgomery?) will be factors this season and Harris is a strong TD regression candidate. His low ceiling (he had two weekly finishes better than 14th last season) limits him to flex territory.",

    "seasonOutlook": "After barely seeing the field during his rookie season, Dillon replaced Jamaal Williams as Aaron Jones' backfield running mate in 2021. Dillon ended up 20th among backs in carries and was more productive than expected as a receiver, posting the second-best catch rate (92%) and YPT (8.5) at the position. The lukewarm usage allowed the occasional big game (four top-15 fantasy outings), but Jones' presence generally kept him off the fantasy radar (10 weekly finishes of 30th or worse). Dillon has thus far been effective and his combination of a huge frame (6-foot, 247 pounds), receiving chops and the Packers' high-scoring offense is appealing. However, his path to consistent fantasy production would involve Jones missing time. In the meantime, Dillon is an elite insurance stash.",

It was an odd season for Hopkins, as he was seeing career-low usage (6.1 targets per game after averaging 9.1 per game during 2015-20), but was on a career-best TD pace (WR-high 13.1% TD rate more than doubled his 5.4% career rate). We should expect TD regression, but Hopkins is always busy near the goal line (top 12 in end zone targets each of the last seven seasons) and remains a super-reliable target (19 drops in 136 games). Hopkins can get back to fantasy WR 1/2 status once his suspension ends, but he's now 30 years old and will miss nearly half of the fantasy regular season.

During the regular season, Knox led all tight ends in touchdowns (nine) and TD rate (12.3%), while finishing fourth in end zone targets (nine). On the negative side, Knox was targeted only 73 times (20th at the position) and fell short of a top-10 fantasy campaign. The 25-year-old's usage doesn't figure to rise much in 2022, so even in an elite Buffalo offense, he's best viewed as a good TE2.",

Penny's career had previously been marred by injuries, as he has appeared in 37 of 65 possible games in his career (57%). Of course, he's been extremely productive when healthy, as his career 5.6 YPC is second best among backs (minimum 150 carries) since he was selected in the first round of the 2018 draft. Penny is not a factor in the passing game (31 career targets) and rookie Kenneth Walker III will be involved as well, so especially considering Seattle's likely offensive struggles, it's safest to view him as a flex/bench option.",

Pierce seems to have major upside, but lacks top-end speed (4.59 40-yard dash) and it's fair to wonder if he'll be viewed as a three-down back after never clearing 106 carries or 23 targets during four seasons at Florida. Still, he has a shot at a major role with 32-year-old Rex Burkhead his primary competition for touches. Pierce is on the flex radar who could flirt with RB2 numbers.",

And yet he still failed to post his first ever top-10 fantasy campaign. The primary culprit: A lack of rushing production. Carr has never cleared 140 rush yards in a single season and has six rushing TDs in eight campaigns. That will continue to limit Carr's fantasy output, but the good news is that he enters 2022 with the best supporting cast of his career after Las Vegas acquired Davante Adams as a running mate for Darren Waller, Hunter Renfrow and Josh Jacobs. Carr should be considered a strong QB2 with back-end QB1 upside.",

He split backfield duties with Javonte Williams in Denver last season and posted a career-best 2.2 YAC, which was in the 80th percentile among backs. Despite the impressive season, Gordon hasn't had a top-12 fantasy campaign since 2018 and is now 29 years old.

Those two categories will regress and Dallas was otherwise around league average in most key categories, so a step back for this unit is likely. On the plus side, Dallas returns nearly its entire core and the biggest loss (Randy Gregory) was replaced by Dante Fowler Jr. and rookie Sam Williams.

The 2018 second-round pick racked up 11 TDs and 22 end zone targets during the 2019-20 seasons, but plummeted to four end zone targets (24th at TE) and two TDs (34th) in 2021. The 26-year-old has more competition for targets this season with Tyreek Hill in the mix, but a dip in targets can be offset by more scoring opportunities in what should be a better offense. Gesicki is a TE2.",

Cook may never come close to the volume his brother enjoys, but he's joining an elite Buffalo offense and has big upside as a receiving specialist.

His 5-foot-8 frame won't allow much usage as a rusher (career-high 89 carries) and, while the QB change to Matt Ryan could mean more targets, Indianapolis already targeted RBs at an above-average rate last season, so we can't count on much of a boost.

Tampa Bay's high-volume, pass-heavy offense has supported three fantasy-relevant wide receivers at times over the last two seasons, though Gage has plenty of competition for work via Mike Evans, Chris Godwin and Julio Jones. Godwin could miss some early action as he recovers from a torn ACL, which could mean early-season WR3 production for Gage, but his ceiling appears limited when all four receivers are healthy.",

He's still been at or above a 24% share in seven straight seasons, which is impressive, but the missed time and career-low TD output (five TDs the last two seasons) have led to the recent slump.

However, he ranked first in INTs and dealt with a league-high 39 drops, ending up with just 12 passing TDs and some extremely ugly efficiency numbers (33.5 QBR, 6.0 YPA, 60% completion rate). Of course, the struggles are not uncommon for a rookie, and his play improved in the final month of the season. Lawrence's supporting cast will be much better in 2022 with new coach Doug Pederson, as well as Christian Kirk, Travis Etienne Jr., Evan Engram and Brandon Scherff.

With the Steelers' quarterback situation a work in progress, Pickens is a longshot for consistent early-career fantasy production, but he has major long-term upside. Consider him with a late-round pick.",

Once back on the field, Gallup will be positioned for a generous target share behind CeeDee Lamb in a productive, high-volume offense. At the same time, Gallup has yet to deliver a top-20 fantasy campaign in four tries and his only top-35 season was back in 2019.

He obviously as a lot of fantasy appeal due to his rushing, but he was also aggressive as a passer, leading the league with a 9.8 average depth of throw.

Jones handled a solid 21% target share during both campaigns and, despite the Jaguars' offensive struggles, has reeled off three consecutive top-35 fantasy seasons. His TDs took a dive last season (four, his lowest since 2016), but it was extremely unlucky (he tied for second in the NFL with 15 end zone targets). Jones' age is a concern, as is added target competition led by Christian Kirk, but an every-down role coupled with a Trevor Lawrence second-year leap would keep Jones in the fantasy discussion. He's a fine bench option.",

Cleveland wasn't as aggressive this past offseason, but it didn't need to be, with 10 of the top 12 in 2021 snaps back on the roster. The unit has stars (Myles Garrett, Denzel Ward, John Johnson III), as well as several emerging recent early-round picks (Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah, Greg Newsome II, Grant Delpit).

Robinson has sufficient speed for his size and his collegiate elusiveness and tackle breaking numbers were both strong.

His 48% catch rate, 4.7 yards per target and 0.9 yards per route run were all 87th or worse among 91 qualified wide receivers. Anderson has 18th- and 19th-place fantasy seasons on his resume, but has been 39th or worse three of the past four seasons. It's hard to get too excited here, but perhaps the arrival of Baker Mayfield will help Anderson to a bounceback. His top-20 fantasy showing in Matt Rhule's offense in 2020 also adds some hope, but he's too risky to consider before the later rounds.",

He was on the field for more than 60% of pass plays in three games and posted 5-66-1, 5-43-1 and 4-45-1 receiving lines during those outings.

Winston's last full season (2019) resulted in a fifth-place fantasy finish and while he's unlikely to match that same volume, his aggressive nature (top six in average depth of throw in all six seasons) offers some hope for fantasy-relevance.

More importantly, the defense looks good on paper, with 14 of the top 15 players in snaps on the AFC Championship roster set to return. The defense is led by terrific duos at edge (Sam Hubbard, Trey Hendrickson), safety (Jessie Bates and Vonn Bell) and tackle (D.J. Reader, B.J. Hall) and are solid at corner and linebacker.

Herbert reached 18 carries and 70 rushing yards in all four games, but a lack of scoring (one TD) and receiving work (10 targets) limited him to the 18th-most fantasy points among RBs during the span. Herbert appears to be a solid backfield option, so there's some insurance appeal here, but he won't have standalone value as long as Montgomery is healthy.",

That was on display last season, as he averaged 19.9 yards per reception, a class-best 13.1 yards per target and 9.5 yards after the catch. Williams tore his ACL in the national title game, but the former hurdler is only 21 years old and won't be rushed by a rebuilding Detroit team.

A 6-foot-4, 222-pound perimeter receiver, Collins was sent deep often (12th-highest average depth of route), but simply wasn't thrown at much, and even when he was, 26% were off target (fifth highest). Collins enters 2022 with a clear path to an every-down role opposite Brandin Cooks. Of course, his prospects will revolve around how well Davis Mills plays in his second season. Collins is a bit of a lottery ticket well worth late-round consideration.",

He played at a \"small\" school, but his outstanding combination of size, speed, athleticism and versatility makes him an intriguing prospect. He has a path to an every-down role in an elite Packers' offense, as his top competition is oft-injured Allen Lazard, Randall Cobb and Sammy Watkins, but it may take him a while to earn that role after missing a lot of preseason action.

The Alabama product was, at worst, average in notable categories like QBR (51.0), YPA (7.3) and completion rate (68%), the latter of which was eighth best in the league. The bad news is that Jones unsurprisingly was a nonfactor with his legs (15 scrambles in 17 games). His fantasy production was extremely boom/bust and included five top-10 weeks, as well as 10 finishes of 22nd or worse. Jones will need elite passing numbers in order to reach QB1 status, and while that's possible (adding DeVante Parker helps), it's obviously unlikely. He's worth no more than a late-round flier.",

Granted, his ceiling will be limited by the Colts' run-heavy offense, but Pierce has a path to every-down snaps as the team's likely No. 2 wide receiver behind Michael Pittman Jr. With Matt Ryan in town, Pierce very well could flirt with occasional flex value.

The 2018 first-overall pick has flashed at times (especially late in the 2020 season), but inconsistent play and a lack of rushing contributions (571 yards and 5 TDs in 60 games) has left him without a single top-15 fantasy campaign. Mayfield is aggressive (career 8.8 average depth of throw) and a potential breakout 2021 season was derailed by injury, so a sliver of hope remains for the 27-year-old. Mayfield's offensive line won't be as good in Carolina, but he does have a good group of targets led by DJ Moore, Christian McCaffrey and Robbie Anderson. Mayfield is only worth drafting late in superflex leagues.",

Robinson's explosiveness and versatility (he can contribute as a rusher and returner) should lead to, at least, a gadget role in New York this season.

Even if he develops into an effective pro rusher, White is a likely committee back, and usage/production similar to Jordan Howard may be his ceiling.

Green has ranked no lower than 13th at the position in end zone targets each of his last four seasons. He will play a lesser role this season after the acquisition of Marquise Brown, though he'll see a boost in work during DeAndre Hopkins' six-game suspension to open the season.

Granted, he was oft-targeted near the line of scrimmage (7.4 aDOT), but Samuel's 79% catch rate paced all wide receivers in 2020. His durability is a concern (he's missed 23 games in five seasons) and Terry McLaurin and perhaps first-round pick Jahan Dotson will be ahead of him for targets, but he's entering his age-26 season and certainly could return to the flex discussion. Samuel deserves some late-round consideration.",

Mack has proven to be an effective rusher (career 4.4 YPC, 1.8 YAC), but he's a nonfactor as a receiver (83 career targets), which along with shaky durability (two-plus missed games in all five NFL seasons) has left him without a top-20 fantasy campaign. With 32-year-old Rex Burkhead and Day 3 rookie Dameon Pierce as his chief competition, Mack has a legitimate path to leading the team in carries.

Poor rookie-season pass efficiency isn't a major concern, so a big second-year leap is very possible. Wilson added some value with legs (including four TDs) as a rookie and his 2022 prospects are heightened by an improved supporting cast led by Elijah Moore and early-round rookies Garrett Wilson and Breece Hall.

Despite falling out of favor in Tampa Bay, there is hope for Jones, as he's shown to be an effective rusher and is still pretty young (25). Also, he's joining an elite offense that doesn't have a proven long-term answer at running back. Clyde Edwards-Helaire is the favorite for lead-back duties, but his inconsistent production and durability woes present Jones an opportunity for substantial work.

The 27-year-old has primarily worked as a backup/situational player, though he was busier than ever during a career-year in 2021. He finished third among backs in carries inside the 5 yard line (14) and was also top 10 in routes, receptions, receiving yards. His 19th-place finish in fantasy was his first-career top-60 campaign. Williams' career rushing efficiency is underwhelming, but he's been effective as a receiver and is in a good spot as oft-injured James Conner's potential backup (Eno Benjamin is also in the mix) in a productive offense. Standalone value is doubtful, but if Conner misses time, Williams will be a must add.",

He's been busy when healthy, though, posting a target share of at least 17% each of the last five seasons. He has a path to a share in that range again this seaso, but he'll first need to pass Isaiah McKenzie in order to take over as team's replacement for Cole Beasley in the slot. Crowder is 29 years old and has never had a top-25 fantasy campaign, so while his ceiling is limited, Buffalo's elite, pass-heavy offense is enough to make him worth a late-round flier.",

Osborn scored in five of the six games and was 18th in fantasy points during the span.

Small hands (8.5\") and age (easily oldest among the top QB prospects) are knocks, but that's more than offset by his strong passing efficiency. Pickett will compete with Mitchell Trubisky to replace Ben Roethlisberger as the Steelers' starting QB and the history of first-round QBs suggests he'll be under center full time by mid-season.

Likely scored at least five TDs in all four seasons at Coastal Carolina while running nearly half of his routes from the slot. He is a bit undersized and may not emerge as an impact blocker, but he's a decent athlete (class-best 36-inch vertical at the combine) with good speed and receiving skills. An impressive offseason has Likely positioned as the Raven's possible No. 3 receiver, so folks in two-TE leagues can draft him.",

Edwards racked up 852 yards and six TDs from scrimmage while pacing Baltimore's backfield in carries (144) and touches (153). Dobbins will be the lead man in 2022, but he's also coming off a torn ACL and isn't yet established as an NFL lead back. Once activated from the PUP list, Edwards figures to play a solid role as a rusher, but a miniscule role as a receiver (24 targets in 43 games) pushes him off the flex radar.

In Wilson's defense, he was pretty good last season, ranking no lower than 13th among wide receivers in catch rate (74%), yards per target (9.9) and RAC (5.8). The 26-year-old aligned in the slot on 79% of his routes in Dallas and figures to see similar usage between Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle in Miami.

He is extremely efficient (his 79% catch rate and 11.4 YPT ranked third and his 6.9 RAC sixth among wide receivers in 2021) and his 33rd-place fantasy finish would've been better if not for almost no goal-line work (one end zone target). As good as Bourne played, the 27-year-old seems stuck in a situational role and that is doubtful to change with Jakobi Meyers and Nelson Agholor back and DeVante Parker and Tyquan Thornton added to the mix.

Haskins' YAC and FMT rates were both below average and he wasn't overly impressive on 22 targets. Haskins ran for 30 TDs in three seasons and is the only back in the class without a single collegiate fumble (on 476 career touches). He's reliable, but not dynamic. Haskins is a natural D'Onta Foreman replacement and would share the backfield with Dontrell Hilliard in the event of a Derrick Henry injury. He has some insurance appeal.",

Howard (Buffalo) and Gronkowski (retired) are both gone, of course, leaving Brate to compete with Kyle Rudolph and rookie Cade Otton. He's theoretically positioned as a fantasy sleeper considering Tampa Bay's high-scoring offense, but note that he posted a 9-88-1 receiving line on 21 targets during a six-game stretch Gronk was out/limited last season (Howard's stats were almost identical those weeks).

Ryan Tannehill is the Titan's clear-cut starter and that won't change as long as he's healthy and Tennessee is competing for a playoff spot.

    "seasonOutlook": "Jones signed with Jacksonville after spending his first five NFL seasons with Buffalo and Las Vegas. The 2017 second-round pick didn't work out with the Bills and was a backup for most of his first 2 1/2 seasons with the Raiders, but he emerged as one of Derek Carr's top targets after last season's Week 8 bye. From that point on, Jones averaged 6.3 targets per game while working primarily as a vertical threat (11th-highest average depth of target). The usage didn't allow much production (43.1 yards per game and zero TDs) and Jones remains without a top-30 fantasy campaign for his career. The 27-year-old will compete for a starting gig in Jacksonville, but he's a long shot for a big enough role to allow consistent fantasy production. He belongs on waivers.",

Garoppolo has always been efficient and that's reflected in his career 8.4 YPA, which is best among all qualified QBs since he was drafted in 2014. It's also reflected in his 2021 numbers, as he ranked sixth in completion percentage (68%), second in YPA (8.6) and 12th in QBR (53.0). However, none of that has translated to much fantasy success. Garoppolo is very conservative (6.9 aDOT since 2019), offers very little with his legs (192 yards in 63 career games) and has missed substantial time due to injury. In turn, he's yet to provide a single top-12 fantasy campaign. Now 30 years old and a backup, Garoppolo isn't on the fantasy radar.",

    "seasonOutlook": "Vaughn is entering his third NFL season and the 2020 third-round pick is positioned for a larger role behind Leonard Fournette after Ronald Jones II's departure. Vaughn hasn't been asked to do much so far (62 carries and 18 targets in 16 career games), but he's been effective in a small sample: his 2.8 YAC is tops among 98 RBs with at least 60 carries over the last two seasons. The 25-year-old doesn't have standalone fantasy value, especially with passing-down specialist Giovani Bernard in the mix, but he'd likely be the lead back in the event of a Fournette injury, which would launch him into, at least, the RB2 mix. Assuming he fends off rookie Rachaad White, Vaughn will be a fine bench option.",
