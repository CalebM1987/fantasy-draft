Taylor's season started and ended slowly (zero top-10 fantasy outings during Weeks 1-3 and 16-18), but it was as good as it gets in the middle (11 straight top-10s during Weeks 4-15). Taylor found the end zone 20 times and his 26 carries inside the opponent's 5-yard line were the most the league had seen in a single season since 2012. An uptick in passing-game work would be nice (unlikely with Nyheim Hines in the mix), but Taylor's age (23), massive usage in a run-heavy offense and top-end efficiency are plenty enough to allow continued elite production. He should be the first pick in 2022 fantasy drafts.",

After not missing a single game and playing 85% of the snaps during his first three NFL seasons, McCaffrey has been limited to 10 games over the last two seasons. The good news is that McCaffrey is only 26 years old and has remained extremely productive when active. Excluding two games he left injured in 2021, McCaffrey was a top-15 fantasy RB in all five \"full\" games he played. Despite missing more than half the season, he finished 15th among RBs in receiving yards. McCaffrey remains the feature back in Carolina and 200-plus carries and 90-plus receptions is attainable. Durability is an obvious concern, but McCaffrey's elite per-game production makes him hard to pass on in the top five in 2022 fantasy drafts.",

Kupp continues to dominate after the catch, ranking top 12 in RAC in each of his five NFL seasons. It's reasonable to expect Kupp to come back to earth this season, especially considering he's now 29 years old and has missed action in three of five NFL seasons, but he's still a lock for a substantial target share in one of the league's top offenses.

Cook still enjoyed plenty of volume (top 10 among RBs in touches and yards for the third straight season), but he took a major dive in the scoring department (six TDs after totaling 30 during 2019 and '20) and saw a career-low 3.7 targets per game.

The good news is that he's positioned as New Orleans' lead back and will remain a featured target in the pass game (he's never finished lower than fifth among RBs in targets). There are concerns, however. Kamara's efficiency took a big hit without Drew Brees around last season (career-low 3.74 YPC and 66% catch rate) and he's unlikely to hold up for 17 games (he's missed at least one game each of the last four seasons). Kamara is also in jeopardy of a multi-game suspension for an offseason arrest. The 27-year-old is a strong bet for RB1 production when active, but he'll be a risky early-round investment until his off-field situation is resolved.",

One of the safest players in fantasy for more than a half decade, Adams has finished no worse than 10th in fantasy PPG each of the last six seasons. That includes three top-three finishes in fantasy points over the last four seasons. Adams is an elite talent and he'll still be heavily targeted by college teammate Derek Carr, but we obviously need to lower expectations a bit. Carr is solid, but he's not Aaron Rodgers and we also can't assume he'll be in the 97th percentile in target share, which is where he's been the past four seasons. Adams also has more competition for targets, he's now 29 years old and he tends to miss the occasional game or two. It's safest to view Adams as a mid-range WR1 rather than the elite play he's been in recent years.",

Samuel finished no lower than second in yards per reception, yards per target, yards per route run and top-10 fantasy weeks. He is nothing short of an elite playmaker, as he's averaging 6.2 yards per carry and a WR-best 9.7 RAC since he was drafted. Samuel's new role as a ballcarrier raises durability concerns, but the 26-year-old will undoubtedly be an elite fantasy option on a week-to-week basis.",

His fantasy production was boom/bust, as he produced five top-10 fantasy weeks, but also eight finishes of 40th or worse.

Kelce finished first at the position in routes, touchdowns and top-10 fantasy weeks, as well as second in targets, receptions and yards. It was another tremendous season, but there are concerns. Kelce's snaps have been trending down in recent years and, in 2021, he posted a career-low catch rate (68%) and yards per target (8.3), as well as his lowest target share since 2016 (22%). He also matched a career low with four end zone targets. Kelce will turn 33 this year, but he's still a featured target (perhaps more so with Tyreek Hill gone) in an elite, pass-heavy offense. Kelce remains a top-two fantasy TE.",

The good news is that Lamb has been very effective when targeted (80th percentile or better in YPT, YPRR and RAC last season) and more volume is available after Amari Cooper was traded and with Michael Gallup recovering from a torn ACL.

Andrews was fantasy's top-scoring TE by 38 points, though it's worth noting his splits with/without Lamar Jackson. In 11 games with Jackson, Andrews averaged 7.9 targets and 14.9 fantasy PPG (four top-five weeks). In six games with Jackson out, Andrews averaged 10.8 targets and 22.9 fantasy PPG (top five all six weeks). This suggests Andrews may not continue his late-season surge, but the departure of Marquise Brown locks him into a massive target share. Also, he has never finished lower than fifth at the position in average depth of target and he's been top two in end zone targets each of the last three seasons. Andrews is an elite fantasy asset and positioned for his fourth straight top-six fantasy campaign.",

Jones finished as a top-12 fantasy RB for the third year in a row, though his rushing production was down considerably. Durability is a concern here, as Jones has missed at least two regular-season games during four of his five NFL campaigns.

The 2021 second-round pick played 51% of the snaps and was effective as both a rusher (2.57 YAC ranked seventh) and pass-catcher (43 receptions, 13th among RBs). Williams showed his elite upside during the one week Gordon was sidelined, exploding for 178 yards and one TD on 29 touches. Gordon is back, but a reduced role is likely at age 29, especially with a new coaching staff in place. Williams, meanwhile, is very young (22), can contribute as both a rusher and receiver and will benefit from an offense that will be more productive with Russell Wilson under center. Williams has an elite ceiling and should be viewed as a fringe RB1.",

We saw Conner in that role for six weeks last season and the results were impressive. He totaled 665 yards and 10 TDs on 130 touches, trailing only Jonathan Taylor in fantasy points during the span. Of course, Conner was productive even with Edmonds active thanks to heavy usage near the goal line. Conner registered 12 carries from opponent's 1-yard line, which was three more than any other player. He finished no lower than third among RBs in TDs (18), expected TDs (11.8) and carries inside the 5-yard line (16). Probable TD regression is likely to be offset by more touches, so 27-year-old Conner is very much on the RB1 radar and has top-five upside.",

The Penn State product followed that up with a 10th-place finish (three missed games) in 2019 before missing all but two games due to injury in 2020. A pair of early-season top-10 outings last season had Barkley back on track, but a freak Week 5 ankle injury cost him four games and he never quite bounced back. Perhaps the new coaching regime will re-ignite Barkley's career -- he's only 25 years old and has minimal competition for touches -- but the rough 2021 efficiency and 21 missed games over the last three seasons means we must lower expectations. Barkley is best viewed as a mid-range RB2.",

In 2021, Evans missed a game-and-a-half, but still paced the position in routes (616) and scored 14 TDs despite ranking outside the top 20 in targets, receptions and yards.

Chubb has handled an underwhelming 55% of the carries and 5% of targets during 17 games with Kareem Hunt over the last two seasons, but high-end efficiency and TD numbers have allowed RB1 production during the stretch. That's unlikely to be sustainable, but the Cleveland offense should be improved when Deshaun Watson is under center late in the season.

The 2018 first-round pick was fantasy's No. 18 WR last season, but had a low ceiling, delivering only three weekly finishes better than 22nd (only one of which was a top 10). The culprit was, once again, touchdowns. Moore is the only player in NFL history with at least 1,100 receiving yards and fewer than five TDs in more than two seasons (he's done it each of the last three seasons). Still, the 25-year-old is heavily targeted (sixth at WR last season) and has overcome weak QB play to finish top 10 in receiving yards each of the past three seasons. He's a solid WR2 and, with any luck in the TD department, he could leap even higher, especially with Baker Mayfield now under center.",

The 2020 second-round pick first took on lead-back duties in Week 13 of the 2020 season and, since that point, he's played a substantial role in 10 games. During those outings, he's averaging 19.9 carries and 2.4 targets per game. Akers failed to impress off his surprising return from the Achilles injury during the playoffs (2.6 YPC), but he's only 23 years old and figures to be much closer to full strength come Week 1. Akers may be limited as a pass-catcher (especially with Darrell Henderson Jr. in the fold), but he's the lead back in an offense that is second in the league in carries inside the 5 since Sean McVay joined the team in 2017. Akers is a major breakout candidate.",

The 2019 second-round pick has emerged as one of the league's top WR talents in recent years, but he just can't seem to get over the top and join the elite fantasy scorers at the position. Part of the issue was Tennessee's run-heavy scheme, but it's also related to the six games he's missed due to injury over the last two seasons. The good news is that Brown has seen big target shares (seventh at WR each of the last two seasons), has been a TD machine (24 TDs in 43 games) and his efficiency has been elite (no lower than seventh in YPT, RAC and YPRR since he was drafted). He is safest as a fantasy WR2, but he'll be Jalen Hurts' primary target in Philadelphia and has a shot at his second top-12 fantasy campaign.",

Herbert's passing output was obviously outstanding, but he also added some value with his legs, ranking top 10 in carries, yards and TDs.

Williams saw more high-percentage targets last season, but still ranked among the top 15 receivers in yards per reception and end zone targets for the fourth consecutive season. One concern is that, after a hot start, Williams reverted to his pre-2021 usage and production. During Weeks 1-5, he had a 26% target share and was the No. 2 fantasy WR. After that, he saw a 19% share and was WR25. In total, he had eight top-20 fantasy outings, but was 40th or worse in his other eight games. Of course, Williams is one of standout QB Justin Herbert's top two targets in one of the league's best offenses. That keeps him in the WR2 discussion.",

He is shockingly inconsistent in fantasy for a player of his caliber (two games with 34 or more points, but also six single-digit outings last season) and doesn't see much goal-line work (career-high six TDs and seven EZ targets). Durability has also been an issue, as he's missed at least two games each of the last three seasons (13 total). Despite all of that, he's still finished no worse than fourth in fantasy PPG each of the last four seasons. Kittle's connection with new 49ers' QB Trey Lance is yet to be seen, but, at worst, he's likely to provide mid-range TE1 production.",

Jackson remains the class of the position in the rushing department, having finished first or second in carries and rush yards all four seasons as a starter. Losing top receiver Marquise Brown hurts, but Jackson is in his prime (25 years old) and remains a mid-range QB1 with elite upside.  ",

His fantasy success has been extremely volume-based, as he sits fourth in targets (314) but also third lowest in yards per target (6.64) among WRs with 120-plus targets over the last two seasons. For better and for worse, Johnson's output was affected substantially by late-career Ben Roethlisberger, who has since retired. The QB change makes Johnson's 2022 outlook a bit cloudy, but even if his target share dips, his downfield work very well could rise.

Waddle's upside was limited a bit by his short-area role (7.0 aDOT was in the 10th percentile) and a lack of goal line work (three end zone targets), but he still managed a strong 14th-place fantasy finish. Waddle appears to be the real deal, though he may have trouble making a leap forward in 2022 with Tyreek Hill added to the fold. Coach Mike McDaniel will surely make plenty use of Waddle, but barring major progress from Tua Tagovailoa, the 23-year-old is best viewed as a good WR2.",

He racked up a massive 6,107 yards and 78 TDs on 788 touches at Clemson, which included 85 receptions over his final two seasons. Etienne's elusiveness jumps off the page, as his 4.1 YAC ranked third and his 3.3 forced missed tackle rate sixth in the 2021 class.

Last season, the volume remained, but efficiency plummeted (Russell Wilson missing time didn't help) and Metcalf ended up 13th in fantasy (23rd in PPG) with a 75-967-12 line. He has a lot going for him -- he's 24 years old, perhaps the most physically intimidating WR in the league and oft-targeted deep downfield and near the goal line (top five in end zone targets in all three NFL seasons). However, Seattle has major QB issues with Russell Wilson out and Drew Lock in, which will hurt Metcalf in the scoring and efficiency departments. He's still in the WR2 mix, but riskier than in past years.",

He is a well-built, three-down back who racked up 3,044 yards and 41 TDs on 532 carries during his final two seasons at Iowa State. Hall has passing-game chops, having caught 93 passes during three FBS seasons, and he rushed for a TD in an NCAA-record 24 consecutive games to finish his career. He's one of the youngest backs in this year's rookie class and he crushed the combine, running a 4.39 40-yard dash and posting a class-best 40-inch vert and 126-inch broad jump. Hall profiles as a potential feature back with a high fantasy ceiling, though Michael Carter will remain involved, especially in the passing game. Hall's combination of talent and opportunity should land him in the RB2 mix in 2022.",

Cooks hasn't been a big factor in the TD department (he's been under seven TDs each of the last four seasons), but that's been easily offset by high-end efficiency (career 9.2 yards per target) and target shares (25% over last two seasons). Houston's QB situation remains a question mark, but he and projected starter Davis Mills had a solid connection last season (69-736-5 receiving line on 96 targets). Cooks remains an underrated WR2.",

Of course, there are two major reasons for optimism heading into 2022: 1.) he's still extremely young at age 23. And 2.) Denver's QB situation went from poor to great after the trade for Russell Wilson. Jeudy has already seen a decent target share (21%), but has an ugly 54% catch rate and only three touchdowns on 167 targets, including zero on 55 targets in 2021. We can anticipate much better efficiency and a big boost in scoring in 2022. Wilson led both DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett to fantasy stardom in Seattle and is a good bet to do the same for the super-talented Jeudy, who is safest as a WR3, but possesses elite upside.",

Despite missing two games, Jacobs finished no lower than 12th among backs in carries, targets, touches, yards and fantasy points last season. His fantasy production was about as high floor/low ceiling as you can get, as he delivered only two top-10 fantasy weeks, but never fell below 34th in 15 outings. It's possible new coach Josh McDaniels utilizes more of a committee (Kenyan Drake, Ameer Abdullah and Zamir White are on the roster), but Jacobs' role as the lead ball carrier and goal line option keeps the 24-year-old in the RB2 mix.",

Dobbins averaged 7.4 fantasy PPG during his first nine NFL games before posting 13-plus points in six consecutive games to finish the season (17.0 per game). Gus Edwards will remain involved as a rusher and Dobbins may struggle for targets in Greg Roman's scheme (Baltimore is dead last in RB targets over the last four seasons), but Dobbins' elite athleticism and role in Baltimore's high-scoring offense is enough to allow RB2 production.",

The 2020 second-round pick was outside the top 20 in passing yards and TDs last season, but he made up for it by pacing the position in carries, rushing yards and rushing TDs. The rushing prowess helped him to a healthy 20.0 fantasy PPG, which ranked seventh at the position. Hurts will benefit from a respectable supporting cast that includes an elite offensive line and standout targets A.J. Brown, DeVonta Smith and Dallas Goedert. Hurts remains a work in progress as a passer, which makes his seat quite hotter than your usual QB1 target, but his elite rushing ability supplies him with top-five fantasy upside.",

Sure, he'll have more competition moving forward (Jameson Williams and DJ Chark Jr. were added and both D'Andre Swift and T.J.

Godwin, who has ranked no worse than fourth in catch rate each of the last three seasons, is in his prime at age 26 and benefits from Tampa Bay's pass-heavy, Tom Brady-led offense.

Despite managing only 35 touches in 2021, he tied for eighth in the league in end zone targets. With Emmanuel Sanders and Cole Beasley gone, Davis is primed for a much larger role in Buffalo's pass-heavy/high-scoring offense in 2022. There's some risk here considering Davis has yet to produce a top-55 fantasy campaign, but he's on a strikingly similar trajectory to Chris Godwin and is a major Year-3 breakout candidate.

He was a top-20 fantasy back in seven of 11 regular-season outings, though his output was limited by a lack of goal-line work (six TDs and four carries inside the 5) and limited passing-game work (20 targets). Nothing about Kyle Shanahan's offense suggests we should expect a major change in role, and new QB Trey Lance may actually steal even more goal-line work.

The GOAT attempted 719 passes last season, which is the second most in a single season in NFL history. He also paced the league in completions, passing yardage and passing TDs, and only two QBs scored more fantasy points. Bruce Arians is out and Todd Bowles in as head coach, which could lead to more offensive balance, but it's no accident that seven of Brady's last eight offenses have been pass-first (if not extremely pass-heavy). Brady is 45 years old and doesn't offer much with his legs (81 yards last season), but he's still playing at an elite level, won't be short volume and has a good group of targets. We should expect a slight step back this season, but Brady remains a solid fantasy starter.",

It's fair to wonder if late-career Ben Roethlisberger has been a major culprit for the fall-off, as Smith-Schuster has seen his average depth of target and yards per target plummet the last two seasons. JuJu is still very young (25) and has a path to No. 1 WR duties in the Chiefs' high-scoring, Patrick Mahomes-led offense. He's safest as a WR3/flex, but there's tremendous upside.",

Robinson is no longer his team's No. 1 wide receiver (Cooper Kupp fills that role in L.A), but he'll be playing with what will easily be the best quarterback (Matthew Stafford) he's had in his career.

Cooper has generally been a solid WR2 (he's never finished worse than 29th in fantasy PPG), but he simply hasn't made the leap to WR1 territory (zero season finishes better than 10th). On the plus side, he's only 27 and has a clear path to a hefty target share as Deshaun Watson's top target in Cleveland.

Thomas had finished four consecutive seasons as a top-seven fantasy WR before 2020. Thomas no longer has Drew Brees throwing him passes, which is sure to decrease his previously terrific efficiency, but Jameis Winston was solid even with a shaky WR room in 2021.

Renfrow has lived in the short area, ranking in the eighth percentile or lower in average depth of target all three seasons. Of course, his efficiency has been great, as he's second at the position in catch rate and sixth in RAC since he was drafted (min. 200 targets). As good as Renfrow has been, the 26-year-old is ticketed for fewer targets this season with Davante Adams in the mix and Darren Waller back to full health. A repeat top-10 fantasy campaign is unlikely, but Renfrow will see enough work to keep him on the WR3 radar.",

Prescott was more boom/bust than other top fantasy QBs, as he produced nine top-10 weeks (tied for fifth), but also five finishes of 20th or worse. A reason for that was a concerning dip in rushing, as his carries, rush yards and rushing TDs were all easily career-low marks in full seasons. Amari Cooper may be gone, but Prescott still has a good supporting cast led by CeeDee Lamb and he leads a pass-heavy offense.

His weekly splits are a bit alarming, as he did most of his damage in three games (two against a beat-up Baltimore team). Burrow scored 32% of his fantasy points in those three games, which marked his only weekly finishes better than eighth for the season. That's a concern, but he has the benefit of arguably the league's best WR room, and an overhauled offensive line will help his cause after he took a league-high 51 sacks in 2021. Burrow's ceiling is a bit capped by limited rushing contributions (40-118-2 rushing line in 2021), but his elite passing production keeps him in the QB1 mix.",

Sanders has missed nine games due to injury over the last two seasons, but he's been an effective rusher when active, ranking top 15 in yards per carry during each of his three pro seasons. He has, however, struggled as a receiver (4.2 YPT over the last two seasons) and figures to continue deferring some backfield work to Kenneth Gainwell and Boston Scott (not to mention Jalen Hurts). Sanders' TDs will regress to the mean and, if he stays healthy, there's a path to a big rebound season. That said, your safest bet is to target him as a flex.",

Pierce seems to have major upside, but lacks top-end speed (4.59 40-yard dash) and it's fair to wonder if he'll be viewed as a three-down back after never clearing 106 carries or 23 targets during four seasons at Florida. Still, he has a shot at a major role with 32-year-old Rex Burkhead his primary competition for touches. Pierce is on the flex radar who could flirt with RB2 numbers.",

Of the defense's top 11 players in snaps last season, only two (Levi Wallace, Jerry Hughes) departed, and the unit is actually better on paper after Von Miller, DaQuan Jones and first-round pick Kaiir Elam were added to a group that includes stars Tre'Davious White, Jordan Poyer and Micah Hyde, as well as recent first-round picks Ed Oliver and Gregory Rousseau. The Bills' defense remains stacked and primed for another elite fantasy campaign.",

He was 11th among all RBs in fantasy points during six full games with Chubb in 2021 and was 13th in 11 games in 2020. Hunt has generally been limited to around one-third of the carries with Chubb in the mix, but his elite efficiency (NFL-best 2.4 YAC since he was drafted) and passing-game involvement have been enough to allow strong fantasy output. Hunt is safest as a flex target, but he has added value as one of the top insurance backs in the game.",

The 2018 second-round pick is coming off the best season of his career, though he appeared in all 17 games and still wasn't better than 20th in targets, receptions, yards, TDs or fantasy points. Kirk's salary suggests he'll be a featured target, but he'll need a big leap from Trevor Lawrence and more goal-line work (22 career end zone targets) in order to produce his first career top-25 fantasy campaign.

He was a situational player most of the season, and though he did play a full-time role during the final four weeks of the season, Lamar Jackson was out with an injury. Bateman delivered three 80-plus-yard games, though he was severely underutilized near the goal line (three end zone targets), which allowed him only one touchdown and no weekly fantasy finishes better than 18th. With Marquise Brown gone, Bateman has a clear path to No. 1 wide receiver duties and joins Mark Andrews as Jackson's clear top-two targets. The 22-year-old is a major breakout candidate and can be considered a WR3 with upside.",

The second part was the five games after McKissic's season-ending injury, during which Gibson averaged 15.0 carries and 4.6 targets and was sixth in fantasy points. In total, Gibson ended up no lower than eighth in touches, yards and touchdowns. McKissic is back and Washington drafted Brian Robinson Jr. in the third round, which is expected to lessen Gibson's role. Gibson figures to hang on the RB2 radar until Robinson (NFI list) is healthy, but he's possible he won't be more than a fringe flex once this is a three-headed committee.",

Smith looks the part of a star receiver, but he'll be hard-pressed to see a big boost in targets after the acquisition of A.J.

It also resulted in the sixth-most fantasy points at the position, as Stafford finished no lower than eighth in pass attempts, completions, yards, TDs and yards per attempt. There's some survival bias baked into Stafford's sixth-place finish -- he was 11th in fantasy PPG -- and it can't be ignored that he's a nonfactor as a rusher (his last rushing TD came in 2016). That said, Stafford operates in Sean McVay's pass-heavy scheme and has a good supporting cast led by Cooper Kupp and Allen Robinson II. The 34-year-old reigning Super Bowl MVP is best viewed as a back-end QB1.",

Nearly all of Harris' production was generated on the ground, as he ranked 10th among backs in rushing yards, but 62nd in targets. He was especially busy at the goal line, finishing second in rushing TDs (15) and third in carries inside the 5-yard line (14). Harris has been an effective rusher (career 4.8 YPC, 1.9 YAC), but he averaged 13.0 carries and 1.1 targets per game once Rhamondre Stevenson stepped into a sizable role, and that was with James White on IR. Stevenson and perhaps a passing-down specialist (Ty Montgomery?) will be factors this season and Harris is a strong TD regression candidate. His low ceiling (he had two weekly finishes better than 14th last season) limits him to flex territory.",

Lockett has also been very efficient, ranking fifth in catch rate (72.4%) and sixth in YPT (9.8) since he entered the league. Of course, it's fair to worry about both scoring and efficiency with Russell Wilson out and Drew Lock in at quarterback.

He aligned in the slot 96% of the time during his first two seasons at USC, but flipped to 85% perimeter in 2021 and enjoyed a breakout campaign. He handled a massive 38% target share when active, which allowed an 88-1,084-7 receiving line during a season cut short by a broken ankle. London is one of the youngest players entering the league, but he's set for an immediate every-down role in an Atlanta offense that badly needed WR help. The Falcons' QB situation is a concern, but London will see enough targets to warrant weekly WR3/flex consideration, at least.",

    "seasonOutlook": "After barely seeing the field during his rookie season, Dillon replaced Jamaal Williams as Aaron Jones' backfield running mate in 2021. Dillon ended up 20th among backs in carries and was more productive than expected as a receiver, posting the second-best catch rate (92%) and YPT (8.5) at the position. The lukewarm usage allowed the occasional big game (four top-15 fantasy outings), but Jones' presence generally kept him off the fantasy radar (10 weekly finishes of 30th or worse). Dillon has thus far been effective and his combination of a huge frame (6-foot, 247 pounds), receiving chops and the Packers' high-scoring offense is appealing. However, his path to consistent fantasy production would involve Jones missing time. In the meantime, Dillon is an elite insurance stash.",

This comes after a lost 2021 campaign in which he was limited to 10 games due to injury. It was an odd season for Hopkins, as he was seeing career-low usage (6.1 targets per game after averaging 9.1 per game during 2015-20), but was on a career-best TD pace (WR-high 13.1% TD rate more than doubled his 5.4% career rate). We should expect TD regression, but Hopkins is always busy near the goal line (top 12 in end zone targets each of the last seven seasons) and remains a super-reliable target (19 drops in 136 games). Hopkins can get back to fantasy WR 1/2 status once his suspension ends, but he's now 30 years old and will miss nearly half of the fantasy regular season. He's only worth considering in the middle rounds.",

The 2018 UDFA is coming off career-high marks in all the key categories -- targets, receptions, receiving yards, touchdowns and fantasy points -- but that was only enough for a 47th-place finish. Lazard was busy near the goal line (he tied for eighth in the NFL with 12 end zone targets), but he missed two games due to injury, bringing him to eight over the last two seasons. All that said, Lazard is only 26 years old and has a path to a much-larger role with Davante Adams' massive target share out of the way. A healthy Lazard could conceivably lead the Aaron Rodgers-led Packers in targets, so he can't be ignored as a late-round flier.",

Green Bay has finished around mid-pack in most categories during the stretch, but did finish sixth with 18 INTs in 2021. Turnovers are tough to predict, but a loaded secondary led by Jaire Alexander and Adrian Amos suggests many more are in their future. Eleven of the team's top 12 defenders in 2021 snaps are back and it's hard to find a weakness with Kenny Clark up front, Preston Smith and Rashan Gary on the edge, De'Vondre Campbell re-signed at linebacker and the aforementioned strong secondary.

Lance is young (22) and extremely inexperienced (one full season as a college starter), but his combination of size, arm talent and elite rushing ability supplies him with major fantasy upside. Lance has some obvious risk, but he has a good supporting cast and is a major breakout candidate well worth mid-round consideration.",

Penny's career had previously been marred by injuries, as he has appeared in 37 of 65 possible games in his career (57%). Of course, he's been extremely productive when healthy, as his career 5.6 YPC is second best among backs (minimum 150 carries) since he was selected in the first round of the 2018 draft. Penny is not a factor in the passing game (31 career targets) and rookie Kenneth Walker III will be involved as well, so especially considering Seattle's likely offensive struggles, it's safest to view him as a flex/bench option.",

Freiermuth averaged only 8.2 yards per reception (fourth lowest), but caught 76% of his targets (ninth best) and scored six touchdowns (sixth most). The Steelers' QB situation remains dicey, but Freiermuth was seventh in fantasy points per snap as a rookie and is an obvious candidate for more work and another leap forward in his second season.

He doesn't do much after the catch (weak 4.2 RAC in 2021, 3.8 for career) and will need to clean up late-career drops (seven in 2021). His combination of polish, speed, route-running and ball skills supplies him with big upside and, even with Michael Thomas and Jarvis Landry in the fold, he has a path to a solid target share in 2022. Olave is a fine flex option and he could quickly emerge as Jameis Winston's top target if the oft-injured Thomas misses more time.",

The 2020 second-round pick's reception total, yardage, catch rate, off-target rate, yards per reception, yards per target and even his end zone targets (seven in 2020, eight in 2021) were about the same both seasons, but the scoring dip dropped him from 23rd to 37th in fantasy points at WR. Ben Roethlisberger's late-career falloff was an obvious culprit and, though the Steelers' QB situation remains shaky, Claypool is still on the rise at age 23 and has great size at 6-foot-4, 238 pounds.

Toney's high point came in a Week 5 game in which he racked up 189 yards, the seventh-most by a rookie in a single game during the last 20 seasons. Toney didn't see much goal-line work (zero TDs, two end zone targets) and was primarily used in the short area (6.4 aDOT), though he made up a ton of ground with the ball in his hands (6.0 RAC ranked 10th). Durability and New York's QB situation are concerns, but Toney has elite playmaking ability and a new coach in Brian Daboll. Target him as a flex with major breakout potential.",

How's that for an incredible stat? Gordon has found the end zone 67 times over the last six seasons after going scoreless as a rookie in 2015. He split backfield duties with Javonte Williams in Denver last season and posted a career-best 2.2 YAC, which was in the 80th percentile among backs. Despite the impressive season, Gordon hasn't had a top-12 fantasy campaign since 2018 and is now 29 years old. He's a strong bet to defer more work to Williams and figures to cap out as a pedestrian flex option, though he does have elite insurance value.",

That 2021 campaign included a terrific 70-1058-12 receiving line in 11 games. Wilson figures to immediately slide in as a starter opposite second-year Elijah Moore, with Corey Davis and Braxton Berrios also in the fold.

Interceptions have been an issue (nine in 2021), but this is a very good defense on paper, led by stars Nick Bosa, Fred Warner, Jimmie Ward and Arik Armstead.  Several regulars departed during the offseason, but they were replaced by players returning from injury, as well as free-agent signings Kerry Hyder, Kemoko Turay and -- most importantly -- new top corner Charvarius Ward. This is a fine starting option in fantasy.",

Robinson tore his Achilles late in the 2021 season, which puts his early 2022 availability (and effectiveness) in doubt. Even if ready to play, Robinson will, at best, be sharing the backfield with 2021 first-round pick Travis Etienne Jr. Once healthy, the 220-pound Robinson figures to contribute primarily as a rusher (he owns a career 4.55 YPC), with Etienne the bigger factor in the passing game.

The 2018 fifth-round pick has taken \"boom/bust vertical target\" to the extreme, ranking first in average depth of target (15.8) and yards per reception (17.5), but last in catch rate (50.2%) and off-target rate (32%) since entering the league.

The Minnesota offense will look different with new coach Kevin O'Connell calling the shots, but that may actually lead to more passing volume for Cousins. The 34-year-old doesn't offer much with his legs (career high of 179 rush yards), but he's been playing at a high level for years and has Justin Jefferson, Adam Thielen and Dalvin Cook in his arsenal.

Carter hit a high in Week 8 against the Bengals, pacing all backs in fantasy points thanks to 172 yards and a score on 24 touches. His playing time dwindled from there, however, and he missed three games due to injury. Carter impressed as a rookie and has upside as a receiver, but he's a bit undersized and is now likely to be limited to situational carries and a passing-down role behind Hall. Carter has some insurance appeal, but he figures to struggle for consistent flex production.",

He totaled 230 carries during four seasons at Georgia (career-high 113 as a senior), but his efficiency was terrific, as he averaged 6.5 yards per carry and 9.4 yards per target while not dropping a single one of his 78 career targets. Cook may never come close to the volume his brother enjoys, but he's joining an elite Buffalo offense and has big upside as a receiving specialist.

Gesicki is fresh off a 2021 season in which he posted career-high marks in targets, receptions and yardage en route to his second consecutive top-eight fantasy campaign. Gesicki's fantasy production would've looked even better if not for a huge dip in goal line work. The 2018 second-round pick racked up 11 TDs and 22 end zone targets during the 2019-20 seasons, but plummeted to four end zone targets (24th at TE) and two TDs (34th) in 2021. The 26-year-old has more competition for targets this season with Tyreek Hill in the mix, but a dip in targets can be offset by more scoring opportunities in what should be a better offense. Gesicki is a TE2.",

    "seasonOutlook": "The Dallas D/ST was the top-scoring fantasy unit in 2021, which ended a streak of 11 straight seasons finishing 14th or worse. The success was driven primarily by an enormous 26 INTs, which is the third most by a defense over the last decade, as well as 10 TDs, which was more than the nine the unit totaled the prior six seasons. Those two categories will regress and Dallas was otherwise around league average in most key categories, so a step back for this unit is likely. On the plus side, Dallas returns nearly its entire core and the biggest loss (Randy Gregory) was replaced by Dante Fowler Jr. and rookie Sam Williams. This defense has a few holes, but enough stars in DeMarcus Lawrence (who missed most of 2021), Micah Parsons and Trevon Diggs to generate another good fantasy campaign.",

He was extremely efficient, ranking third in this class in both YAC and FMT rate. Walker has a ways to go in the passing game (a 5% target share led to a 13-89-1 receiving line last season), but he's young (21) and sports a terrific speed/power combo (4.38 40-yard dash). Walker will open his career behind Rashaad Penny, but the latter's major durability concerns positions the rookie as an intriguing insurance stash.

Despite appearing in all 17 games, Hines posted career-low marks in routes, targets, receptions and receiving yards. His 5-foot-8 frame won't allow much usage as a rusher (career-high 89 carries) and, while the QB change to Matt Ryan could mean more targets, Indianapolis already targeted RBs at an above-average rate last season, so we can't count on much of a boost.

Every WR in league history with at least 104 receptions has more than two TD catches � except Meyers, who has two on 168 receptions. Bad luck is part of the issue, but so is a lack of goal-line work (10 career end zone targets). Meyers' targets figure to dip this season with DeVante Parker (among others) added to the mix, so the 25-year-old is best viewed as a low-ceiling PPR flex.",

He's thus far been very conservative (his 7.0 average depth of throw ranked near the basement of the league last season) and hasn't added much with his legs, but perhaps both will change with Mike McDaniel running the offense.

He could handle upward of half the carries and the occasional target (he's never cleared 22 in a single season), with Chase Edmonds and perhaps Myles Gaskin also involved in the offense.

He was utilized both inside and out (39% career slot rate) and showed strong efficiency (his career 90% adjusted catch rate and 2.9 YPRR are both second best in this year's rookie class) and elite hands (four drops on 256 career targets). Moore is on the small side, but he has the biggest hands in this class and showed well athletically at the combine. Moore has a shot at a sizable rookie-season role if he can overtake the likes of JuJu Smith-Schuster, Mecole Hardman and/or Marquez Valdes-Scantling for work. One of Patrick Mahomes' top targets if he progresses well, Moore needs to be on your mid-round radar.",

The 2018 sixth-round pick had emerged as one of Matt Ryan's go-to targets over the last two seasons, though most of the slot man's work has come in the short range (career 8.5 aDOT) and very little has been near the goal line (nine TDs, 19 end zone targets in his career). Tampa Bay's high-volume, pass-heavy offense has supported three fantasy-relevant wide receivers at times over the last two seasons, though Gage has plenty of competition for work via Mike Evans, Chris Godwin and Julio Jones. Godwin could miss some early action as he recovers from a torn ACL, which could mean early-season WR3 production for Gage, but his ceiling appears limited when all four receivers are healthy.",

Burks ran a solid 4.55 40-yard dash at 225 pounds (heaviest in the class) at the combine. With A.J. Brown gone, Robert Woods is the Titans' clear No. 1 WR, but Burks very well could pick up a huge target share as a rookie if he develops well.

However, he ranked first in INTs and dealt with a league-high 39 drops, ending up with just 12 passing TDs and some extremely ugly efficiency numbers (33.5 QBR, 6.0 YPA, 60% completion rate). Of course, the struggles are not uncommon for a rookie, and his play improved in the final month of the season. Lawrence's supporting cast will be much better in 2022 with new coach Doug Pederson, as well as Christian Kirk, Travis Etienne Jr., Evan Engram and Brandon Scherff.

Once back on the field, Gallup will be positioned for a generous target share behind CeeDee Lamb in a productive, high-volume offense. At the same time, Gallup has yet to deliver a top-20 fantasy campaign in four tries and his only top-35 season was back in 2019.

He saw more low-percentage/deep balls in 2020 and, combined with weak QB play (27% off target rate was third highest at WR) and three missed games, he fell outside the top 40 receivers. His 2021 season ended with a broken ankle in Week 4. Chark is a big, fast perimeter target, but his ceiling will be limited with Amon-Ra St. Brown, D'Andre Swift, T.J. Hockenson and inevitably rookie Jameson Williams ahead of him for targets. Chark belongs on benches, though Williams' ACL recovery could allow the 25-year-old some early-season flex value.",

Most of his damage has come down field (career 14.2 aDOT) and he's shown good hands (two drops on 142 career targets) and ball skills. Pickens has some discipline issues, but he's only 21 years old and can develop as the No. 3 behind Diontae Johnson and Chase Claypool. With the Steelers' quarterback situation a work in progress, Pickens is a longshot for consistent early-career fantasy production, but he has major long-term upside.

He's still been at or above a 24% share in seven straight seasons, which is impressive, but the missed time and career-low TD output (five TDs the last two seasons) have led to the recent slump. Landry is now 29 years old and has more competition than usual for targets with Michael Thomas and Chris Olave in the mix. Landry figures to max out as a PPR flex in deeper leagues.",

Despite appearing in only 12 games, Fields ranked fifth among QBs in rushing yards for the season. He obviously as a lot of fantasy appeal due to his rushing, but he was also aggressive as a passer, leading the league with a 9.8 average depth of throw.

Cook was sidelined for four games in 2021 and Mattison produced 518 yards and three TDs on 105 touches in his stead. He paced all backs in fantasy points during the span. Mattison is extremely young for a fourth-year vet (24), but he'll remain no more than an elite insurance option as long as Cook is in the picture.",

Injuries (15 missed) and Hooper's presence derailed Njoku's production during the 2019-20 seasons, but he bounced back a bit in 2021 thanks to great efficiency -- top five in RAC (6.8) and YPT (9.0) -- and a boost in goal line work (his seven end zone targets ranked 11th). The 2017 first-round pick is still only 26 years old and will be a featured target this season. He's safest as a back-end TE2, but a big leap is possible.",

During the first half of the season, Henderson was playing three-quarters of the snaps and providing RB2 fantasy production. Injuries cost him all but a few snaps in the second half of the season and he ended up working behind a healed Akers in the Super Bowl. By all accounts, Akers will be the main man in the Los Angeles backfield moving forward, leaving Henderson to situational work.

His TDs took a dive last season (four, his lowest since 2016), but it was extremely unlucky (he tied for second in the NFL with 15 end zone targets).

That includes elite CB duo Xavien Howard and Byron Jones, as well as key contributors Christian Wilkins, Jerome Baker, Emmanuel Ogbah and emerging star Jevon Holland.

    "seasonOutlook": "Smith returns as the top tight end in Minnesota after missing all of 2021 with a knee injury. Smith has thus far been limited to 91 targets in 29 regular-season games (3.1 per game) and has yet to deliver a top-20 fantasy campaign. With Kyle Rudolph sidelined during the final four weeks of 2020, Smith posted a strong 15-183-3 receiving line and was TE4 in fantasy, though he was out-targeted 22-to-20 by Tyler Conklin. Of course, Rudolph and Conklin are gone, which positions Smith for a big boost in usage in 2022. The 2019 second-round pick is still very young (entering his age-23 season) and makes for a solid TE2 with room for more.",

Robinson is a huge power back, who ranked at or near the top of this year's rookie class in weight (225 pounds), hand size and wingspan. He was used sparingly during his first three seasons at Alabama, but emerged as lead back in 2021, posting a 271-1,343-14 rushing line in 14 games, adding 35-296-2 as a receiver. Robinson has sufficient speed for his size and his collegiate elusiveness and tackle breaking numbers were both strong. Robinson seemed to pass Antonio Gibson on the depth chart during Training Camp, but a gunshot wound will cost him at least four weeks of the regular season. Stash Robinson on your bench or IR, if possible, as it's possible he'll be an RB2/flex option later this season.",

Of course, even with Gibson around, McKissic was 17th in fantasy points in 2020 and 22nd prior to the injury last season. McKissic's role will allow him to occasionally flirt with PPR flex value.",

The 2021 third-round pick will again be competing with the same three receivers he worked behind last season, and while he won't pass Keenan Allen and Mike Williams on the depth chart, Jalen Guyton's No. 3 role is attainable. That's especially the case after Palmer flashed on the rare occasions he played a big role. He was on the field for more than 60% of pass plays in three games and posted 5-66-1, 5-43-1 and 4-45-1 receiving lines during those outings. Palmer is only 22 years old and, while standalone value will be tough early on, he's one injury away from a major role in the Chargers' high-scoring, Justin Herbert-led offense.

Winston did play pretty well prior to the injury (fifth-best QBR) and he'll have a better group of targets with Michael Thomas, Jarvis Landry and rookie Chris Olave now in the fold. Winston's last full season (2019) resulted in a fifth-place fantasy finish and while he's unlikely to match that same volume, his aggressive nature (top six in average depth of throw in all six seasons) offers some hope for fantasy-relevance.

His 48% catch rate, 4.7 yards per target and 0.9 yards per route run were all 87th or worse among 91 qualified wide receivers. Anderson has 18th- and 19th-place fantasy seasons on his resume, but has been 39th or worse three of the past four seasons. It's hard to get too excited here, but perhaps the arrival of Baker Mayfield will help Anderson to a bounceback. His top-20 fantasy showing in Matt Rhule's offense in 2020 also adds some hope, but he's too risky to consider before the later rounds.",

He has delivered the occasional big fantasy season during his career (second place in 2016 and 2018), but he's also finished 11th or worse five of the last seven seasons despite often ranking near the top of the league in pass attempts. That's especially a concern as he heads to a run-heavy Indianapolis offense that will continue to lean heavily on Jonathan Taylor. Ryan is now 37 years old and has never cleared 147 rushing yards in a single season. He's an upgrade for the Colts, but is not in a good spot from a fantasy perspective. Consider him a fringe QB2 with limited upside.",

Gainwell will battle for a larger share of the pie this season, but Miles Sanders and Boston Scott will both be involved as well.

The 2018 first-overall pick has flashed at times (especially late in the 2020 season), but inconsistent play and a lack of rushing contributions (571 yards and 5 TDs in 60 games) has left him without a single top-15 fantasy campaign. Mayfield is aggressive (career 8.8 average depth of throw) and a potential breakout 2021 season was derailed by injury, so a sliver of hope remains for the 27-year-old. Mayfield's offensive line won't be as good in Carolina, but he does have a good group of targets led by DJ Moore, Christian McCaffrey and Robbie Anderson. Mayfield is only worth drafting late in superflex leagues.",

The Alabama product was, at worst, average in notable categories like QBR (51.0), YPA (7.3) and completion rate (68%), the latter of which was eighth best in the league. The bad news is that Jones unsurprisingly was a nonfactor with his legs (15 scrambles in 17 games). His fantasy production was extremely boom/bust and included five top-10 weeks, as well as 10 finishes of 22nd or worse. Jones will need elite passing numbers in order to reach QB1 status, and while that's possible (adding DeVante Parker helps), it's obviously unlikely. He's worth no more than a late-round flier.",

Instead, he was limited to five games in 2020 due to injury before missing three more games and struggling badly to produce in the Giants' horrific offense in 2021. Golladay went from ranking first at the position in touchdowns and third in end zone targets (15) in 2019 to failing to score a single TD in 2021. Golladay is now 28 years old and has struggled with durability for two seasons, but it's hard to throw in the towel on a 6-foot-4 vertical target who has had his level of success. There's at least hope for a rebound with Brian Daboll in town, so Golladay is a worthwhile late-round dart throw.",

Hardman's three seasons of low target shares (he hasn't cleared 13% in a season) are a red flag, but the departure of Tyreek Hill certainly opens up a major opportunity in what is Hardman's first contract year.

Herbert reached 18 carries and 70 rushing yards in all four games, but a lack of scoring (one TD) and receiving work (10 targets) limited him to the 18th-most fantasy points among RBs during the span.

That included eight top-10 outings (tied for fifth). Despite playing in a tough AFC West, Denver allowed the eighth-fewest yards and third-fewest points last season, but struggled to create turnovers (21st) and sacks (18th). Offseason addition Randy Gregory should help with the latter and helps fill out a solid overall defense that is a little light on star power (Justin Simmons the obvious exception), but solid or better on all levels. This is a midrange fantasy unit with top-10 potential if second-year players Patrick Surtain II and Baron Browning make a leap.",

The wheels fell off from there, as he failed to produce another top-12 outing before missing the final six games due to injury. Durability is a real concern, as he's missed at least two games during each of his three NFL seasons. Jones has yet to deliver a top-20 fantasy campaign, but there is a sliver of hope here after New York hired Brian Daboll as head coach. Also, much like Daboll's previous QB, Josh Allen, Jones' legs are an asset; he ranks sixth at the position with 1,000 rushing yards since 2019. Jones is worth a look only as a QB2 toward the end of your draft.",

For starters, after years of horrendous production, the unit made a leap in nearly every category last season, including top-15 finishes in INTs and sacks. More importantly, the defense looks good on paper, with 14 of the top 15 players in snaps on the AFC Championship roster set to return. The defense is led by terrific duos at edge (Sam Hubbard, Trey Hendrickson), safety (Jessie Bates and Vonn Bell) and tackle (D.J. Reader, B.J. Hall) and are solid at corner and linebacker.

Pacheco's collegiate efficiency was about as poor as it gets (4.3 YPC and 3.7 YPT are both worst in this class), though he had little help (his 1.6 yards before contact is easily lowest in the class). Pacheco was also weak in the YAC and FMT categories, but added some value as a returner and pass blocker. He'll battle for touches behind Clyde Edwards-Helaire and perhaps Ronald Jones.",

Okwuegbunam very well could cap out as a TE2, especially with third-round rookie Greg Dulcich eventually in the mix and with Denver so strong at wide receiver, but a full-on third-year breakout is certainly possible. Consider Okwuegbunam with one of your final picks.",

Prior to the lost year, Watson finished as a top-five fantasy QB in three straight seasons and it could have been four if not for a torn ACL as a rookie in 2017. The dual-threat playmaker ranked no lower than sixth among QBs in rushing yards in each of his last three seasons, while adding 15 TDs with his legs along the way. Watson's passing ability showed continual improvement, as he paced the NFL in passing yards (4,823) and YPA (8.9), while posting 33 TDs and just 7 INTs in 2020. Amari Cooper aside, Watson doesn't have a standout group of targets in Cleveland, but the offensive line is outstanding and his rushing prowess supplies him with elite fantasy upside. Watson will be suspended for the first 11 games of the season, so he's only worth stashing in deep superflex leagues.",

The 2016 third-round pick's fantasy stock took a dive with the Browns, as he followed up a pair of sixth-place fantasy finishes with Atlanta (2018-19) with a pair of finishes outside the top 20 the last two seasons. There were a variety of reasons for the decline, including a drop in targets, a dip in efficiency and shaky durability (seven missed games over the last three seasons). Hooper's upside will be limited in the Titans' run-heavy scheme, though coach Mike Vrabel's TE units in Tennessee have averaged a hefty 24% target share in his four seasons. Hooper is a low-ceiling, fringe TE2.",

Moore's lack of vertical targets and goal-line work (one end zone target) severely limited his fantasy output (three top-40 outings). Moore is only 22 years old and his best days are likely ahead of him, but he may not have a path to a substantially larger role this season with DeAndre Hopkins, Marquise Brown, A.J. Green and Zach Ertz in the fold. He's not worth considering until the last few rounds of your draft.",

Tonyan's huge dip in scoring is obvious, but his catch rate (88% to 62%) and YPT (9.9 to 7.0) also crashed back to earth. His targets were almost identical during the two seasons (3.7 in 2020, 3.6 in 2021) and so, even with Davante Adams gone, it's hard to expect much of an increase this season. The 28-year-old will have some touchdown upside as long as Aaron Rodgers is his quarterback, but he's best viewed as a mid-to-back-end TE2.",

Ingram handled 28 carries (27% share) and nine targets (8%) in those weeks and was 47th in fantasy points during the span. He played two full games with Kamara out and was very effective, producing 100-plus yards and a top-15 fantasy performance both weeks. Ingram isn't a candidate for consistent fantasy production at his age, but with Kamara facing a possible suspension, he could find his way to the RB2/flex radar early in the season.

The yardage total was highest in this year's rookie class. Massively utilized, Tolbert handled a target share of at least 33% and an air-yard share of at least 53% in both 2020 and 2021. He's 6-foot-1 with 10-inch hands, decent wheels and the ability to play inside or out, but is a bit older than most rookies, faced light competition and will need to clean up the drops (eight in 2021). Tolbert's chief competition for No. 3 duties in a good Dallas offense is James Washington (who will miss some time), so there's potential Year 1 fantasy value here (especially if Michael Gallup's ACL recovery costs him game time). Keep him on your radar in the late rounds.",

It's possible that increases with improved targets this season, but that's far from a lock considering he was at 6.4 in his final season with the Rams.

He's primarily a pocket passer, but he's a good athlete and was one of four QBs in this class to scramble for over 400 yards last season. Small hands (8.5\") and age (easily oldest among the top QB prospects) are knocks, but that's more than offset by his strong passing efficiency. Pickett will compete with Mitchell Trubisky to replace Ben Roethlisberger as the Steelers' starting QB and the history of first-round QBs suggests he'll be under center full time by mid-season. He's only worth drafting in superflex and dynasty leagues.",

Collins enters 2022 with a clear path to an every-down role opposite Brandin Cooks. Of course, his prospects will revolve around how well Davis Mills plays in his second season.

Incredibly, Everett's reception and yardage totals have increased every season he's been in the league. He also posted career-high marks in targets, touchdowns and catch rate (75%) last season. Everett has generally been utilized as a short-range target (career 6.7 aDOT) and not much near the goal line (18 career end zone targets), which has left him without a top-20 fantasy campaign. Of course, he's now positioned as the top receiving tight end in an elite Chargers' offense. The 28-year-old is in the TE2 mix and has some late-round appeal.",

The 2021 second-overall pick was limited to nine passing TDs and 11 INTs and ranked among the worst QBs in completion rate (56%), YPA (6.1), sack rate (10.3%) and drop rate (6.3%). Poor rookie-season pass efficiency isn't a major concern, so a big second-year leap is very possible. Wilson added some value with legs (including four TDs) as a rookie and his 2022 prospects are heightened by an improved supporting cast led by Elijah Moore and early-round rookies Garrett Wilson and Breece Hall. Same as most high-pedigree, second-year QBs, Wilson is worth late-round consideration.",

Of course, prior to that, the 2015 second-overall pick struggled during five seasons in Tennessee. Mariota has been effective with his legs throughout his career (264-1,574-13 rushing line), but that has yet to translate to a top-12 fantasy campaign (he's finished better than 18th once).

White's rushing efficiency was pedestrian for the most part, though he eluded tackles at a good rate. He has the look of an impact receiving back in the pros, though he'll struggle for playing time for a while. Leonard Fournette is the Buccaneers' feature back, Giovani Bernard will help in obvious passing situations and 2020 third-round pick Ke'Shawn Vaughn is also in the mix.

The 28-year-old was expected to play a fairly significant offensive role in Las Vegas 2021, but ended up with 93 touches in 12 games while working behind feature back Josh Jacobs. Even when Jacobs was sidelined during Weeks 2 and 3, Drake shared the backfield with Peyton Barber and was limited to 112 yards on 23 touches. The season was a big letdown for a player who had been a top-20 fantasy back each of the prior three seasons. Drake now becomes a longshot for fantasy relevance, but with Gus Edwards on IR and J.K. Dobbins' health uncertain leading into Week 1, it's possible he and Mike Davis handle a generous share of the touches early in the season. Drake is only worth stashing in deep leagues.",

On the plus side, he was stopped for a loss on a class-low 9% of his carries in 2021. Even if he develops into an effective pro rusher, White is a likely committee back, and usage/production similar to Jordan Howard may be his ceiling.

The unit will also have a healthy Bud Dupree and Caleb Farley after both missed extended action last season.

Unsurprisingly, the reunion with Aaron Rodgers didn't lead to much fantasy success. Cobb was limited to 39 targets while primarily working in a situational role. He also missed five games and hasn't played a full season since he was 25 years old back in 2015. Cobb is now entering his age-32 campaign and hasn't been a top-40 fantasy receiver since 2017. He theoretically has a path to more work with Davante Adams gone, but that seems like a long shot considering his age and durability woes, as well as the acquisitions of Sammy Watkins, Christian Watson and Romeo Doubs. Cobb can be avoided in all but the deepest of PPR leagues.",

Mack has proven to be an effective rusher (career 4.4 YPC, 1.8 YAC), but he's a nonfactor as a receiver (83 career targets), which along with shaky durability (two-plus missed games in all five NFL seasons) has left him without a top-20 fantasy campaign. With 32-year-old Rex Burkhead and Day 3 rookie Dameon Pierce as his chief competition, Mack has a legitimate path to leading the team in carries.

After inexplicably being limited to 15 catches during two seasons at Ohio State, Williams exploded for a 79-1572-15 campaign at Alabama in 2021. Williams' rare combination of height, elite speed and quickness make him a major threat for explosive plays. That was on display last season, as he averaged 19.9 yards per reception, a class-best 13.1 yards per target and 9.5 yards after the catch. Williams tore his ACL in the national title game, but the former hurdler is only 21 years old and won't be rushed by a rebuilding Detroit team. Expect a slow start for Williams (he'll miss at least four games while on the NFI list), but he has elite upside and figures to be a fixture in fantasy lineups by midseason.",

Despite falling out of favor in Tampa Bay, there is hope for Jones, as he's shown to be an effective rusher and is still pretty young (25). Also, he's joining an elite offense that doesn't have a proven long-term answer at running back. Clyde Edwards-Helaire is the favorite for lead-back duties, but his inconsistent production and durability woes present Jones an opportunity for substantial work.

The North Dakota State product was one of the biggest winners at the combine, measuring in at 6-foot-4 with 10 1/8-inch hands while showing well in every athletic drill. The latter included a 4.36 40-yard dash and class-best 136-inch broad jump. Watson was utilized in a variety of ways during four seasons at NDSU. He was a vertical threat (career 20.5 YPR on 104 catches), ball carrier (49 carries) and kick returner (27 attempts). He played at a \"small\" school, but his outstanding combination of size, speed, athleticism and versatility makes him an intriguing prospect. He has a path to an every-down role in an elite Packers' offense, as his top competition is oft-injured Allen Lazard, Randall Cobb and Sammy Watkins, but it may take him a while to earn that role after missing a lot of preseason action. Watson should be on your radar in the late rounds.",

He never had an aDOT below 14.7 during four seasons at Cincinnati and he handled at least 24% of the team's air yards when active each of the last three seasons. That includes a 36% share while delivering a 52-884-8 receiving line in 2021. Pierce crushed it at the combine with a class-best 40.5-inch vertical and 4.41 40-yard dash at 211 pounds. Granted, his ceiling will be limited by the Colts' run-heavy offense, but Pierce has a path to every-down snaps as the team's likely No. 2 wide receiver behind Michael Pittman Jr. With Matt Ryan in town, Pierce very well could flirt with occasional flex value. He's worth a look in the late rounds.",

The former second-round pick was primarily utilized as a situational deep threat, posting a 13.3 average depth of target (14th highest among WRs) and averaging 16.0 yards per reception (seventh). Jefferson finished 36th in fantasy points, though that number would've been much worse had Robert Woods not been lost for the season just hours after the Rams traded for Jefferson's replacement (Odell Beckham Jr.). Jefferson has yet to miss a game and has the look of a solid player, but he's behind at least Cooper Kupp and Allen Robinson II for targets, and a major boost in production seems unlikely for the 26-year-old. He's worth a bench spot only.",

He failed to post a weekly fantasy finish better than 15th and deferred substantial playing time to scat back Ameer Abdullah in the second half of the season.

Osborn scored in five of the six games and was 18th in fantasy points during the span.

Dobbins in the second round of the 2020 draft, but it turned out to be a mistake to overlook a young back with a career 5.2 YPC. Edwards racked up 852 yards and six TDs from scrimmage while pacing Baltimore's backfield in carries (144) and touches (153). Dobbins will be the lead man in 2022, but he's also coming off a torn ACL and isn't yet established as an NFL lead back. Once activated from the PUP list, Edwards figures to play a solid role as a rusher, but a miniscule role as a receiver (24 targets in 43 games) pushes him off the flex radar. He's best valued as insurance behind Dobbins.",

That included a late-season six-game stretch in which he played 89% of the snaps and averaged 21.5 carries and 3.3 targets per game. Only eight backs had more fantasy points during the span. Now 27 years old, Michel is a solid back, but he's yet to post a top-30 fantasy campaign. That's unlikely to change in Los Angeles barring a major injury to Austin Ekeler, but it's possible Michel plays a big role as a rusher, leaving Ekeler to focus more on passing situations. Michel is best viewed as a deep league insurance hold, as it's possible he'd lead a committee in the event Ekeler is out.",

Hamler made some noise as a rookie (30-381-3 receiving line), but his efficiency was very poor; he ranked near the basement in catch rate (53%), YPT (6.7), YPRR (1.2) and drop rate (8.8%). Hamler is a small (5-foot-9, 178 pounds) and fast slot WR who has competition for targets with Courtland Sutton and Jerry Jeudy ahead of him on the depth chart. The arrival of Russell Wilson helps his cause, but Hamler has a tough path to consistent fantasy value. Consider the 23-year-old in the later rounds.",

He finished first or second in this rookie class in YPRR (3.5), targets (144), receptions (104) and yards (1,334). Robinson's explosiveness and versatility (he can contribute as a rusher and returner) should lead to, at least, a gadget role in New York this season.

    "seasonOutlook": "Wilson signed a three-year, $22 million contract with Miami after spending his first four seasons in Dallas. The deal was a bit of an eyebrow-raiser considering Wilson was a former sixth-round pick who has been limited to a backup/situational role during his career. In fact, Wilson has 96 targets in his career, 61 of which came in 2021. In Wilson's defense, he was pretty good last season, ranking no lower than 13th among wide receivers in catch rate (74%), yards per target (9.9) and RAC (5.8). The 26-year-old aligned in the slot on 79% of his routes in Dallas and figures to see similar usage between Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle in Miami. Wilson is a long shot for consistent production with Hill, Waddle and Mike Gesicki higher in priority, but he's a name to monitor in deep formats.",

He's played that role the last two seasons, which has allowed rushing lines of 63-301-3 and 55-246-1, as well as receiving lines of 11-66-0 and 27-196-1. Perine's efficiency has been solid in recent years, but he has yet to produce a top-40 fantasy campaign in his five-year career. He can be expected to see a handful of touches each game this season and, should Mixon miss time, he'd lead a committee that would also include passing-down specialist Chris Evans. Perine is worth holding only if you roster Mixon in a very deep league.",

It was a tough break for Samuel after he progressively improved from 126th to 49th to 36th to 25th in fantasy points during his first four NFL seasons in Carolina, the latter of which included 848 yards on 76 receptions and 200 yards on 41 carries. Granted, he was oft-targeted near the line of scrimmage (7.4 aDOT), but Samuel's 79% catch rate paced all wide receivers in 2020. His durability is a concern (he's missed 23 games in five seasons) and Terry McLaurin and perhaps first-round pick Jahan Dotson will be ahead of him for targets, but he's entering his age-26 season and certainly could return to the flex discussion. Samuel deserves some late-round consideration.",

The 2015 fourth-round pick has some limitations, including a lack of work near the goal line (25 career end zone targets), a role limited to the short range (career 7.5 average depth of target) and shaky durability (at least four missed games three of the last four seasons). He's been busy when healthy, though, posting a target share of at least 17% each of the last five seasons. He has a path to a share in that range again this seaso, but he'll first need to pass Isaiah McKenzie in order to take over as team's replacement for Cole Beasley in the slot. Crowder is 29 years old and has never had a top-25 fantasy campaign, so while his ceiling is limited, Buffalo's elite, pass-heavy offense is enough to make him worth a late-round flier.",

That said, it's possible he sees enough work to flirt with occasional flex value, but especially considering he's now 30 years old, it's very likely that he'll settle in as a situational player.
